# Portfolio Qwik App ⚡️ [Aborted project]

I've started this project to create my student portfolio.

Made it with :

- [Qwik (Qwik Builder)](https://qwik.builder.io/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)

---

## Project Structure

This project is using Qwik with [QwikCity](https://qwik.builder.io/qwikcity/overview/). QwikCity is just an extra set of tools on top of Qwik to make it easier to build a full site, including directory-based routing, layouts, and more.

Inside your project, you'll see the following directory structure:

```
├── public/
│   └── ...
└── src/
    ├── components/
    │   └── ...
    └── routes/
        └── ...
```
